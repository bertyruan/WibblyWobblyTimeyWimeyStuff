The BEST time app ever!

This Windows 8 app was created during a 24 hour Microsoft CampAppHack (hackathon)
at Penn State University Park by Jordan Dover, Lukas Miller Laura Searles, and 
Berty Ruan. All four of us were quite inexperienced with XAML and C#, and half of
us had little to no experience with coding. However, despite these difficulties,
we were able to make a working main app page, learn a lot about Windows 8
development, and have a lot of fun! This app also won us a honoray prize for 
sticking it through and doing our best to make a finishing product. Overall, 
all four of us thought it was a successful and an awesome experience with tons
of food and free stuff!
